# 📌 Assignment 3: Python Data Control, Loops & Flow

## 🚀 Overview
This assignment focuses on mastering essential Python concepts, including **data structures, control flow, and loops**. These fundamental topics are crucial for writing efficient and structured Python programs.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Data Structures
1. **Lists**
   - Mutable sequences for storing multiple values.
   - Methods: `append()`, `insert()`, `sort()`, `pop()`, etc.

2. **Tuples**
   - Immutable sequences, used for fixed collections.
   - Supports indexing and slicing.

3. **Dictionaries**
   - Key-value pairs for fast lookups.
   - Methods: `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `get()`, `update()`.

4. **Sets**
   - Unordered collections of unique elements.
   - Operations: `union()`, `intersection()`, `difference()`.

5. **Frozen Sets**
   - Immutable sets that can be used as dictionary keys.

### 🔹 Control Flow
- **Conditional Statements (`if-elif-else`)**
  - Used to make decisions based on conditions.

### 🔹 Loops
1. **For Loop**
   - Iterates over sequences (lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.).

2. **While Loop**
   - Runs code repeatedly until a condition is met.

3. **Loop Control Statements**
   - `break`: Stops the loop early.
   - `continue`: Skips the current iteration.
   - `pass`: Placeholder for future implementation.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding and implementing different data structures.
- Using loops efficiently to automate repetitive tasks.
- Controlling program flow with conditional statements.

## 📝 Instructions
1. Implement all covered concepts in Python.
2. Write sample programs demonstrating list, tuple, dictionary, and set operations.
3. Use loops to iterate through data structures.
4. Apply `if-elif-else` statements for decision-making.
5. Utilize `break`, `continue`, and `pass` for flow control.

## 🚀 Future Applications
These concepts lay the groundwork for more advanced topics like:
- **Data analysis** using Python.
- **Automation & scripting**.
- **Building AI & machine learning models**.

Happy coding! 🎉🚀
